ZKM is an advanced architecture that utilizes [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS\_architecture) (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) architecture - a class of Reduced Instruction Set Computer ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced\_instruction\_set\_computer)) CPU instructions - and harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs ([ZKPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge\_proof)) to achieve its objectives.

zkMIPS aims to provide a verifiable computing solution to trust the computation results generated by untrusted computers. The adoption of the MIPS architecture aligns perfectly with the vision of incorporating zkMIPS into diverse domains such as blockchains and IoT. In the blockchain realm, zkMIPS is seamlessly integrated with blockchain Layer 2 technologies, offering a ZKP layer 2 rollup solution. By harnessing the power of ZKP and leveraging the robustness of the MIPS architecture, zkMIPS aims to fulfill its objectives effectively. In non-blockchain systems including the Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR), decentralized cloud computing, and zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML), zkMIPS enables a secure communication channel by trusting devicesâ€™ computation results. This document serves as a comprehensive introduction, shedding light on the zkMIPS system as well as the possible integration with Layer 2 blockchain projects to offer a hybrid rollup solution.
