# ☀ Getting Started

ZKM stands for Zero-Knowledge MIPS; an advanced architecture that utilizes[ MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS\_architecture) (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) architecture - a class of Reduced Instruction Set Computer ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced\_instruction\_set\_computer)) CPU instructions - and harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs ([ZKPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge\_proof)) to achieve its objectives.

ZKM aims to provide a secure verifiable computing solution to trust the computation results generated by untrusted computers. The adoption of the MIPS architecture aligns perfectly with the vision of incorporating ZKM into diverse domains such as blockchains and IoT. In the blockchain realm, ZKM is seamlessly integrated with blockchain Layer 2 technologies, offering a ZKP layer 2 rollup solution. By harnessing the power of ZKP and leveraging the robustness of the MIPS architecture, ZKM aims to fulfill its objectives effectively. In non-blockchain systems including the Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR), decentralized cloud computing, and zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML), ZKM enables a secure communication channel by trusting devices’ computation results. This document serves as a comprehensive introduction, shedding light on ZKM’s Virtual Machine as well as the possible integration with Layer 2 blockchain projects to offer a hybrid rollup solution.
